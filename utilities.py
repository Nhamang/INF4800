    in Python 3.x map/2 returns an iterator that is evaluated lazily. This poses a problem
    if the return value from map/2 is never traversed and the intent of using of map/2 was
    really to trigger some side-effect from the function application. This utility method
    avoids that, and was written when porting Python 2.7.x code to Python 3.x.
